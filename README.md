# A Simple Smite God Randomizer

I made this little webapp because I was overwhelmed with the number of gods to pick from in Smite, and wanted a computer to decide for me. There are a couple already out there, but they don't offer much in the way of customizing, so picking for certain roles was annoying.

Currently it supports filtering by god type and role, in addition to selecting the current god pool to select from. We don't want any annoying double picks!

Hope you enjoy it :)
